A program for displaying a certain type of pattern that I, after hours of googling, don't know the name of.

* What's interesting: 
The folders G1, G2 and G3 contain patterns generated by this program in jpg or png format.

* Background:
My 3rd grade teacher once showed me a neat way to make nice, oddly unsymmetrical patterns in a notebook. If you start at the intersection of two lines in a normal gridded notebook and draw a line one cell up, then draw a line to the right that is two cells long, then down for three cells and so on until you get to nine, you will have a spiral with 90 degree turns. If you, once you get to 9 reset your length to 1 but keep turning as before you will end upp with a really cool pattern that will return to it's starting position.

I enjoyed this a lot and wanted to do it for lengths other than 9 and angles other than 90, from which this program was born. Once you open it it's rather self-explanatory. Most of the interesting code can be found in sketch.js
